			<h2>WHY AM I DOING THIS? BY THOMAS KNIGHTS</h2>

			<p>
				In the UK, being ginger and male comes with many stigmas attached.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many are bullied at school and for some, even later in life.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as I can see, no one has focused (or noticed) the huge, polarised gap between the way our society perceives red headed women (often the ultimate woman - think Jessica Rabbit) and red headed males (often emasculated and de-sexaulised in ﬁlm and TV). No Hollywood heroes, few leading men.  
			</p>
			<p>
				No other hair colour has this level of gender inequality in any society, and RED HOT holds a mirror up to the pre-conceived limitations we put on the red headed males. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Essentially, what I’m doing is creating an exciting and revealing exhibition showcasing a positive outlook on the red-haired male, and aiming to re-brand the ginger male stereotype along the way.
			</p>
