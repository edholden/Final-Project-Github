		<h2>The RED HOT exhibition experience</h2>
		
		<h3>
		Launch: 16th - 22nd December at The Gallery in Redchurch Street. Private view 17th December, 6pm.
		</h3>
		
		<p>
		The RED HOT exhibition will consist of 50 portraits, including some recognisable faces. Look out for Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford!
		</p>
		<p>
		There will also be a projection wall showcasing two short films, the first is a music video starring many of the RED HOT guys, the second is a ten-minute documentary that aims to highlight the difficulties of growing up as a young male with red hair.
		</p>
		<p>
		RED HOT creator Thomas Knights said: “There will be 50 portraits at the exhibition and a music and fashion film and a documentary. I’m hoping people who might initially come to look at the hot men will leave with a greater awareness of the personal journeys and struggles with identity many of the guys featured went though to have the confidence to be photographed in this way.
		</p>
		<p>
		“Each of the guys will have a short quote next to their picture, positive or negative but related to living with red hair. Im hoping this with add some heart to an exhibition that, taken at surface value, appears shallow, but actually has considered depth and a real sense of cause. The documentary will explore this further and go deeper in to some of the guys character and experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		“I would love the public to go away with an altered perspective of red headed men, and an awareness that there is a problem with our current attitudes, especially in the UK. My ultimate aim is to set in motion change in the media - to create a movement that might see ginger men represented more positively in film, TV and literature like their female counterparts.
		</p>
		<p>
		"The guys (a lot of whom have emailed me directly to take part) often had a strong, confident persona which really shines in film. I think this is a response to feeling marginalised in their youth. Many have grown up questioning themselves and ultimately hating who they are. They change this by dying their hair, then eventually become self confident enough to be true to themselfves. They therefore, i'm my experience doing this, tent to be much more self aware and confident, savvy individuals as adults, which i think can make someone more attractive."

		<h3>The Gallery in Redchurch Street</h3>
